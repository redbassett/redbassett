# Enrico Grillo (He/Him)
### I make things for mobile and web. Sometimes.

I am an interdisciplinary artist and engineer building things that people can interact with. I am trained as a designer for live entertainment with a specialty in lighting design for theatre and stage, but I like just about anything that creates a spectacle in the broadest definition of the word.

While an unfortunate amount of my work cannot be shared as open source, Github is my go-to place for collaborative projects (of which I need more!) and small tests and experiments.

Please talk to me about:
 - Theatre, Circus, Live Music, Festivals, etc
 - Urbanism and Urban Policy
 - Transit, Transportation, and Micromobility
 - Trains!
 - Plenty more to comeâ€¦
